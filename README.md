Learning how the backend works to host a web app using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. 

The idea is to learn to: 
    create your own backend, 
    connect your server to a database and 
    deploy a web site/application. 
    
Along the way, also understand what it takes to develop a professional looking website. 
    
By the end of this project, we should be well versed with a complete understanding of the backend of a website and be able to create our own web applications.
